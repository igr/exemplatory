# Corgi Dogs 🐕

Corgi dogs are running in the Garden.

+ The garden is represented as a simple rectangular matrix.
+ Each Corgi occupies a single cell in the garden. Multiple Corgis can occupy the same cell (they’re small but agile!).
+ Corgis move randomly within the garden—one cell at a time, either up, down, left, or right.
+ Corgis cannot move outside the boundaries of the garden.
+ Each Corgi starts with `10` energy points.
+ Whenever a Corgi enters a cell that already contains one or more other Corgis, it loses `1` energy point. (Corgis already in the cell do not lose energy.)
+ When a Corgi’s energy reaches `0`, it falls asleep and is removed from the garden.
