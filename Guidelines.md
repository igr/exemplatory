# Guidelines

+ You may use any programming language of your choice.
+ Your solution **must** include a [justfile](https://github.com/casey/just) or [makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) to run the project (for example, with `just run` or `make run`). Assume that the required language is already installed on the system.
+ In the `README.md` file, briefly explain your solution and the reasoning behind your approach.
+ Add comments in your code where appropriate to highlight your chosen architecture, design patterns, strategies, or any other important aspects of your implementation.
+ Most importantly — enjoy the process!
