# Guidelines

+ You can use any programming language you prefer.
+ You must include a [justfile](https://github.com/casey/just) or [makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) to run your solution (e.g. `just run` or `make run`). Assume the necessary language is installed on the system.
+ In the `README.md` file, provide a brief description of your solution and the reasoning behind it.
+ Please comment your code as much as necessary.
+ Enjoy the process!
